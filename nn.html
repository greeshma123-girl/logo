    <h1> RADHA KRISHNA </h1>
    <p> as we know that lord krishna is an ordinary person but born as the part of lord maha vishnu </p>
    <p> And lord vishnu had taken a birth as an ordinaryprson to live between us like an human </p>
    <p> not only him all the gods and goddess are also having their births as a human in our earth </p>
    <p> but now lord vishnu had taken too many avatars for us to defeat the villans </p>
    <p> and now i know more abt lord krishna who is everyones fav. but in his whole life he didnt get married to his loved ones instead of 
        loving he became the half of her body.now its the time of speaking their true love. maybe in the universe their is no one that no one could love like that </p>
